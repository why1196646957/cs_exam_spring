1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Technology that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.
    public class smartphone{
b)  Explain what POLYMORPHISM is.
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference
is used to refer to a child class object.
c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number". 
public class Speak{
string name;


d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?
