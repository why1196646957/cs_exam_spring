2)  Consider the following interface:

-----------------------------------------------------
public interface Greetings{

  public String FormalHello();
  
  public String CasualHello();
  
}
-----------------------------------------------------

a)  Explain what an interface is.
An interface is a reference type in Java, it is similar to class, 
it is a collection of abstract methods.
A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.
b)  Write a complete class for a language speaker of your choice, like ItalianSpeaker, which fully implements the interface.
